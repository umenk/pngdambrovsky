Web merge node transparency problem (nuke) hey guys, i&#039;m currently in the process of learning nuke and have stumbled across a transparency issue when i merge my elements over a scene. Web a completely opaque object&#039;s matte is white, a completely transparent object&#039;s matte is black, and a partially transparent object&#039;s matte is gray.</p><h3>Web I Rendered It Out And Saved It As A Png Image Sequence As It Can Store Transparency.</h3><br/><p>Adjust boundary between completely transparent background and partially translucent. Web this is correctly done with the mix slider in the merge node. Government lab that gives a crap pushes open source;</p><h3>Moving This Slider To The Right Makes The Registered Color Region More Transparent.</h3><br/><p>Web 3.9k views 3 years ago. An easier (less nodes) solution would be to get rid of your shuffle. Web u/lemony_snicket is right about the problem.</p><h3>In Your Merge Node Under A Channels Set That To Diffuse, Then To The Right Of That Were It Says None Change That Back To Rgba.alpha.</h3><br/><p>So, here it recognizes the rgb+alpha, whereas over on the canyon it just sees rgb. How can i make it transparent (alpha channel with 0 value)? Web crooks swipe plutonium, cesium from us govt nuke wranglers&#039; car.</p><h3>But When I Load It Into Nuke, It Has The Background Image I Used For Reference Behind Every Frame And No Transparency At All, So I Canâ€™t.</h3><br/><p>See the image and my settings. I need to comp the work in nuke, but clients want to place transparent pngs in their layouts. For what ever reason every time i use an over/under merge to add elements into my shot, it loses a lot of opacity.</p></section>
